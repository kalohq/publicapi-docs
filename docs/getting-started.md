# Getting started
At Kalo we aim to be the source of truth for all of your company’s information about freelancers, and make interactions with them seamless. We know that your team may be using other project management tools, and as such, we want to make it as easy as possible to use Kalo with these 3rd party tools, minimising the amount of duplicate work. 

The Kalo API is a way to build integration between Kalo and any other system or applications you are using to onboard, manage, and pay your freelancers.

To start, you’ll need to create a Kalo app (“Kalo app” is a link to the kalo app management page).

Head over to the [API Overview](./overview.md) page for more details on the resources you can access via the Kalo API.
